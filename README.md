# Framer Project - DEVRAJ PORTFOLIO

This is a static Framer export that can be run locally.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Python (Recommended)
If you have Python installed:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000/imaginative-screens-471831.framer.app/`

### Option 2: Using Node.js
If you have Node.js installed, you can use `npx`:
```bash
npx http-server -p 8000
```
Then open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000/imaginative-screens-471831.framer.app/`

### Option 3: Direct File Open
You can try opening the HTML file directly:
- Navigate to `imaginative-screens-471831.framer.app/index.html`
- Double-click to open in your browser

**Note:** Some features may not work when opening directly due to browser security restrictions. Using a local server (Option 1 or 2) is recommended.

## Running the Server Script

On Windows, you can also run:
```powershell
.\start-server.ps1
```

Or if you have Python:
```bash
python start-server.py
```
